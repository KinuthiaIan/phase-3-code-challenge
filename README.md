#### PythonCodeChallenge1(Toy Problems)

#### Project Description
For this project, I was working the following challenges:

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input.

The task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

## Challenge 2:  Two numbers are positive.
# Task:
Write a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

# Examples:
(2, 4, -3) == True

(-4, 6, 8) == True

(4, -6, 9) == True

(-4, 6, 0) == False

(4, 6, 10) == False

(-14, -3, -4) == False

## Challenge 3: Consonant value
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

# Examples;
For the word "zodiacs", solve("zodiacs") = 26

For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z d cs"

-- The consonant substrings are: "z", "d" and "cs" and the values are z = 26, d = 4 and cs = 3 + 19 = 22. The highest is 26.

For the word "strength", solve("strength") = 57.

The consonant substrings are: "str" and "ngth" with values "str" = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57 and "ngth" = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49. The highest is 57.

#### Project Setup and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
- Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
- cd your-project

## Running the Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Navigate to the file containing your main code (e.g., filename.py).
4. Open a terminal in VS Code.
5. Run the following command to execute the code: python3 filename.py
   N/B: Replace filename.py with the actual name of your Python script.
